# Whatsapp v2

This is a sleek WhatsApp UI clone built with Flutter during a Mobile App Development workshop. The chat screen is fully designed, showing chats and redirecting to a detailed DM screen. Status and calls pages are simple placeholders, accessible via the navbar. This is a purely a front-end recreation with no backend integration.
